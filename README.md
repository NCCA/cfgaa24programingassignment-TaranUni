## Assignment Ideas

- Flip Fluid Sim
- Eulerian Fluid Sim
- Fire Sim
- Particle Based Fluid Sim

## What i'm planning on doing

### ~~Eulerian Fluid Sim, if this is too simple I will extend it to being a Flip fluid Sim.~~

~~In the demo by [TenMinutePhysics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html "Link to TenMinutePhysics")
on [Eulerian fluid](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/17-fluidSim.html "Fluid Sim") he has multiple test enviroments for the simulation,
I think if I start with creating the wind tunnel enviroment this should be the simplest, then I can potentially add the paint test enviroment as I think this is the nicest one to interact with.
I will also just stick with showing just the smoke view.~~

### Particle Based Fluid Sim

After some thinking and looking through the Euler method, I think I will switch to using the particle based method instead as we have been working on something similar in workshops.
I have decided to use this video as referance [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE&) on how to create a realistic particle based fluid sim. I think this method will be easier to implement with current code.

## Design of classes/ Data structures

## How the program will flow
